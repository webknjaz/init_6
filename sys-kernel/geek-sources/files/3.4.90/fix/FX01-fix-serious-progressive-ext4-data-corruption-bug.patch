    jbd2: fix a potential fs corrupting bug in jbd2_mark_journal_empty

    Fix a potential file system corrupting bug which was introduced by
    commit eeecef0af5ea4efd763c9554cf2bd80fc4a0efd3: jbd2: don't write
    superblock when if its empty.

    We should only skip writing the journal superblock if there is nothing
    to do --- not just when s_start is zero.

    This has caused users to report file system corruptions in ext4 that
    look like this:

    EXT4-fs error (device sdb3): ext4_mb_generate_buddy:741: group 436, 22902 clusters in bitmap, 22901 in gd
    JBD2: Spotted dirty metadata buffer (dev = sdb3, blocknr = 0). There's a risk of filesystem corruption in case of system crash.

    after the file system has been corrupted.
